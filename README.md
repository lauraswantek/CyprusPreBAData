# CyprusPreBAData
The data contained in both the TombSizeMaster and TombContentsMaster.csv files was collected for dissertation research on the emergence of social complexity in the Prehistoric Bronze Age on Cyprus using mortuary data.  The data were collected from various publications of cemetery and tomb excavations listed with citations in the AllCemeterieswithReferences.pdf file included here.  

The TombSizeMaster.csv file includes area calculations (square meters) for the total area of rock that was cut to contruct a tomb.  Volume measurements could not be used as height of tomb chambers and entranceways were not always included in publications.  These measurements are included in the spreadsheet when they were available, but not included in the total square meters calculation (column labelled: TotalMetersSquare).  

TombSizeMaster.csv column Names:
Site Name (Name of cemetery or site where tomb is located)
Region (Cyprus was divided into three regions for this reserch: North Coast (North), Central Plain (Central), and South Coast (South).  All tombs are labelled with one of the three region names indicated in parenthesis)  
Period (The dating scheme used in this research splits the PreBA into the Philia Phase (2400-2250 cal BC), PreBA 1 (2250-2000 cal BC) and PreBA 2 (2000-1700 cal BC), labelled as Philia, PreBA 1 and PreBA 2 respectively in the spreadsheet)
TombID (The tomb numbers assigned by original excavators of the site are replicated here as identifiers)
BronzePeriod (The more traditional dating scheme used on Cyprus is included for some tombs in this column.  The periods include the Early Bronze Age or ECI-III, and Middle Bronze Age or MCI-II)
DromosShape (The shape of the dromos or entranceway is recorded here for tombs that have a dromos.  For those that do not, this column is left blank)
DromosLength (Length of dromos in meters)
DromosWidth (Width of dromos in meters)
DromosHeight (Height of dromos in meters where recorded.  This measurement is not included in DromosSquareMeters or TotalSquareMeters column)
